This file documents the AI-assisted coding prompts used during the development of cf_ai_cloudflare_chat_memory.
AI assistance was used to speed up development, clarify Cloudflare Workers APIs, and debug issues.

🛠️ Setup & Environment

Prompt:

"Help me set up a Cloudflare Workers AI project with Durable Objects for memory. Show me the wrangler.toml structure."

Response:
Provided wrangler.toml with [ai], [durable_objects], and [assets] sections.

📝 Durable Object (Memory) Implementation

Prompt:

"Write a Durable Object that stores conversation history, trims old turns, and passes messages to Workers AI."

Response:
Generated memory.ts including ChatSession Durable Object with history storage and trimming logic.
